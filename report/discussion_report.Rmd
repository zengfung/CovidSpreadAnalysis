# Overall impression

## Summary of Report

With COVID-19 cases still on a rise a year after it became a pandemic, and with millions of cases and deaths throughout the world so far, we wanted to find out whether the policies that were implemented during this period of time were effective in slowing down the spread of the disease. What caught our attention was the significant spike in cases and deaths between October and November 2020 in European countries. Hence, we analyzed the change in growth rate of infectious population with respect to the stay-at-home restriction policy among five dense and large European countries (Germany, France, Italy, United Kingdom, and Poland). A panel fixed effect model was fitted, and it was found that the stay-at-home policies did have a significant effect in reducing the spread of COVID-19. However, model diagnostics have shown the issue of cross-sectional dependence, which could lead to false positive error inflation.

## Overall Impression

The report was well-written in general. This was especially true for the introduction and the background sections, as we managed to give a good and engaging overview of COVID-19 to the readers and why the stay-at-home policy is a good question of interest. Additionally, panel regression also turned out to be a really good model for the purpose of this analysis, as it explained the data at hand really well. The few major constructive feedbacks that were received were the lack of legends in certain bar charts making plots a bit harder to interpret, and that the causal interpretation section felt disconnected from the previous sections of the report. These issues will be further discussed in the Major Comments section.

# Major comments 

(1) The introduction section gave a good overview of the project, including a succinct and engaging description of the complex Covid 19 situation, from brief background of the disease, its impact, and different non-pharmaceutical approaches that have been taken to control the spread of the disease. This transfers smoothly into the major question of interest of the study and the objectives. The readers could follow the report well and understand the thought process of the authors. It can be improved by breaking down the long paragraphs into shorter sections.

(2) The background section provided interesting insights on the problem of interest. The reason for choosing infectious population growth rate as the response variable was well explained and justified. The steps for deriving the response variable was also included and was helpful for readers who were not familiar with the disease spread SIR model.

(3) There was a big and long table in section 5.1.3. The table included the estimated regression coefficients and p-values for 28 variables, thus taking up a lot of space. Also it basically provided the same information as the line plot in the same section, so there was no need to include the table in the report.  

(4) Several issues should be fixed to improve visualization:
  
    * In Figures 1-4, the meaning of color is not shown in the report. We deleted the legend due to redundant legend when using Plotly. However, in the slide, we included a simple version of the legend.

    * In the pie chart, Figure 5, the location of the five countries are not corresponding to geography. Thus, we adjusted the plot to be more consistent with what we see on a map.

    * The y axis in Figures 1-4 using different ranges. Though we admit this can be confusing when using different units for five countries, we did not change the units since what we want the reader to see is the pattern (daily change over two months) for each country independently, rather than comparing each country's absolute value.

(5) One of the major issues with the analysis was the causal interpretation. While a propensity score was run using the appropriate generalized Boosted model due to the variable being chosen not being binomial, the assumptions to run the propensity score were not stated. The model that was run seemed took into account many of the confounding variables. This was done by selecting data from a certain time interval and selecting certain countries. However, there were some assumptions that were made to do a propensity score analysis. One was that the countries had similar policies against COVID-19 in the selected time interval. These can include mask mandates, curfews, online schooling, and more. Differences in policies would lead to differing results in the analysis. For the presentation we will mention these assumptions and determine if causal interpretation can actually be made.

# Minor comments 

(1) The tables we put on our report had too many decimal places. Some examples of this were the tables in Section 5.2, where we made a table that discusses the estimates of the model coefficients. Readers generally do not care to read beyond the 3rd decimal places as they donâ€™t impact the results much anyway. In future reports, decimal places in tables should be reduced to at most 3 places.

# Question to address during the final presentation

(1) How do we interpret the fitted model that says that all stay-at-home policies, change in stay-at-home policies, and previous infectious population growth rate are significant?

(2) What does the Type-1 error inflation due to cross-sectional dependence mean for our results?

(3) What were the different cofounders that the model took into account? What variables weren't taken into account?

(4) Why was a Generalized Boosted Model used to estimate the Propensity Score? What is the Generalized Boosted Model?

(5) What is the difference between change in stay at home restriction and stay at home restriction? Why was it important to have both?
